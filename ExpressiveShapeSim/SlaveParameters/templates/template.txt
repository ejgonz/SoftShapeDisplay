# Slave: [ID]

# [CMD1], [PIN], [VAL]
# [CMD2], [PIN], [VAL]

#
# This file contains a template (above) for formatting slave parameters
# White space and # lines are ignored in all files.
#
# The first line must contain the Slave ID as shown above, with “Slave: “ 
# preceding it. The following lines can be in any order and consist of three
# element comma separated lists of command, pin, and value. 
#
# Command list:
#
# Kp		set proportional gain
# Ki		set integral gain
# Kd		set derivative gain
# LS		set lowering speed for a pin
# Disable	disable a pin
#
# Note:
# - Values should be integers between 0 and 255 (likely much lower for gains)
# - A value for disable is required just so that file reading is 
#   standardized. This value can be anything between 0-255.
# - ID should be the desired slave ID number (integer).
